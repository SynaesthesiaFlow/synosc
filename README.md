    - what are our infrasound installations?

# Other, less important Questions
    - what are the computational demands of a vanilla RNN vs something like Coconet
    - what's this? https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/connection-kit/
    - what about putting MIDI inside OSC?

        Tonal Distance: measures the harmonicity between a pair of tracks. Larger tonal distance implies weaker inter-track harmonic relations.
