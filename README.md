# Open Questions
    - what are the computational demands of an RNN vs a more advanced model like Coconet
    - what's this? https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/connection-kit/
    - what about putting MIDI inside OSC?
        http://opensoundcontrol.org/wrapping-other-protocols-inside-osc


# Milestone
    - get noteSequence to Dispatch OSC message


# Notes
    - magenta midi interface: https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/interfaces/midi
    - magenta ableton plugin
        - start by dragging magenta_studio amxd into ableton midi channel

        Tonal Distance: measures the harmonicity between a pair of tracks. Larger tonal distance implies weaker inter-track harmonic relations.
